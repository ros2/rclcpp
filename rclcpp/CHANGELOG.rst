* Updaed code to use logging macros rather than ``fprintf()``. (`#439 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/439>`_)
* Fixed a bug that was using an invalid iterator when erasing items using an iterator in a loop. (`#436 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/436>`_)
* Changed code to support move of ``rcutils_time_point_value_t`` type from ``uint64_t`` to ``int64_t``. (`#429 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/429>`_)
* Renamed parameter byte type to ``byte_values`` from ``bytes_value``. (`#428 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/428>`_)
* Changed executor code to clear the wait set before resizing and waiting. (`#427 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/427>`_)
* Fixed a potential dereference of nullptr in the topic name validation error string. (`#405 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/405>`_)

* Changed to use ``rcl_count_publishers()`` like API's rather than the lower level ``rmw_count_publishers()`` API. (`#425 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/425>`_)
  * Signed-off-by: Sriram Raghunathan <rsriram7@visteon.com>
* Fix potential segmentation fault due to ``get_topic_name()`` or ``rcl_service_get_service_name()`` returning nullptr and that not being checked before access in ``rclcpp``. (`#426 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/426>`_)
