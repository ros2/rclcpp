0.5.0 (2018-06-25)
------------------
* Fixed a bug in the multi-threaded executor which could cause it to take a timer (potentially other types of wait-able items) more than once to be worked one. (`#383 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/383>`_)
  * Specifically this could result in a timer getting called more often that it should when using the multi-threaded executor.
* Added functions that allow you to publish serialized messages and received serialized messages in your subscription callback. (`#388 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/388>`_)
* Changed code to always get the Service name from ``rcl`` to ensure the remapped name is returned. (`#498 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/498>`_)
* Added previously missing ``set_parameters_atomically()`` method to the Service client interface. (`#494 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/494>`_)
* Added ability to initialize parameter values in a Node via a YAML file passed on the command line. (`#488 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/488>`_)
* Fixed the ROS parameter interface which got parameters that aren't set. (`#493 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/493>`_)
* Added ability to initialize parameter values in a node with an argument to the Node constructor. (`#486 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/486>`_)
* Added a ``Subscription`` tests which uses ``std::bind`` to a class member callback. (`#480 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/480>`_)
* Refactored the ``ParameterVariant`` class into the ``Parameter`` and ``ParameterValue`` classes. (`#481 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/481>`_)
* Relaxed template matching rules for ``std::bind`` and ``GNU C++ >= 7.1``. (`#484 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/484>`_)
* Changed to use the new ``rosgraph_msgs/Clock`` message type for the ``/clock`` topic. (`#474 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/474>`_)
* Fixed a flaky ROS time test due to not spinning before getting the time. (`#483 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/483>`_)
* Nodes now autostart the ROS parameter services which let you get, set, and list parameters in a node. (`#478 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/478>`_)
* Added support for arrays in Parameters. (`#443 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/443>`_)
* Changed how executors use ``AnyExecutable`` objects so that they are a reference instead of a shared pointer, in order to avoid memory allocation in the "common case". (`#463 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/463>`_)
* Added ability to pass command line arguments to the Node constructor. (`#461 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/461>`_)
* Added an argument to specify the number of threads a multithreaded executor should create. (`#442 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/442>`_)
* Changed library export order for static linking. (`#446 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/446>`_)
* Fixed some typos in the time unit tests. (`#453 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/453>`_)
  Obviously it mean RCL_SYSTEM_TIME but not RCL_ROS_TIME in some test cases
  * Signed-off-by: jwang <jing.j.wang@intel.com>
* Added the scale operation to ``rclcpp::Duration``.
  * Signed-off-by: jwang <jing.j.wang@intel.com>
* Changed API of the log location parameter to be ``const``. (`#451 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/451>`_)
* Changed how the subscriber, client, service, and timer handles are stored to resolve shutdown order issues. (`#431 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/431>`_ and `#448 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/448>`_)
* Updated to get the node's logger name from ``rcl``. (`#433 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/433>`_)
* Now depends on ``ament_cmake_ros``. (`#444 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/444>`_)
* Updaed code to use logging macros rather than ``fprintf()``. (`#439 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/439>`_)
* Fixed a bug that was using an invalid iterator when erasing items using an iterator in a loop. (`#436 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/436>`_)
* Changed code to support move of ``rcutils_time_point_value_t`` type from ``uint64_t`` to ``int64_t``. (`#429 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/429>`_)
* Renamed parameter byte type to ``byte_values`` from ``bytes_value``. (`#428 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/428>`_)
* Changed executor code to clear the wait set before resizing and waiting. (`#427 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/427>`_)
* Fixed a potential dereference of nullptr in the topic name validation error string. (`#405 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/405>`_)
  * Signed-off-by: Ethan Gao <ethan.gao@linux.intel.com>
* Changed to use ``rcl_count_publishers()`` like API's rather than the lower level ``rmw_count_publishers()`` API. (`#425 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/425>`_)
  * Signed-off-by: Sriram Raghunathan <rsriram7@visteon.com>
* Fix potential segmentation fault due to ``get_topic_name()`` or ``rcl_service_get_service_name()`` returning nullptr and that not being checked before access in ``rclcpp``. (`#426 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/426>`_)
