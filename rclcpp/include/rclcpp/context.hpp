   * the signal handler, otherwise it will be passed over.

   * After calling this method, shutdown() can be called to invalidate the
   * context for derived entities, e.g. nodes, guard conditions, etc.
   * However, the underlying rcl context is not finalized until this Context's
   * destructor is called or this function is called again.
   * Allowing this class to go out of scope and get destructed or calling this
   * function a second time while derived entities are still using the context
   * is undefined behavior and should be avoided.
   * It's a good idea to not reuse context objects and instead create a new one
   * each time you need to shutdown and init again.
   * This allows derived entities to hold on to shard pointers to the first
   * context object until they are done.
