/**
 * @brief This class provides a way for storing and executing timer objects.
 * It provides APIs to suit the needs of different applications and execution models.
 * All public APIs provided by this class are thread-safe.
 *
 * Timers management
 * This class provides APIs to add/remove timers to/from an internal storage.
 * It keeps a list of weak pointers from added timers, and locks them only when
 * they need to be executed or modified.
 * Timers are kept ordered in a binary-heap priority queue.
 * Calls to add/remove APIs will temporarily block the execution of the timers and
 * will require to reorder the internal priority queue.
 * Because of this, they have a not-negligible impact on the performance.
 *
 * Timers execution
 * The most efficient implementation consists in letting a TimersManager object
 * to spawn a thread where timers are monitored and periodically executed.
 * Besides this, other APIs allow to either execute a single timer or all the
 * currently ready ones.
 * This class assumes that the `execute_callback()` API of the stored timers is never
 * called by other entities, but it can only be called from here.
 * If this assumption is not respected, the heap property may be invalidated,
 * so timers may be executed out of order, without this object noticing it.
 *
