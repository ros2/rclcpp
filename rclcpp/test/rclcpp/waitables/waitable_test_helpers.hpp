/// Test that a given waitable is ready after a second wait.
/**
 * The purpose of this test is to check that a waitable will remain ready
 * on subsequent wait calls, if that is the expected behavior.
 * Not all waitables should remain ready after a wait call, which can be
 * expressed in the expected_to_stay_ready argument which defaults to true.
 * If set to false, it will check that it is not ready after a second wait, as
 * well as some other parts of the test.
 *
 * The given waitable should:
 *
 *   - not be ready initially
 *   - not be ready after being waited on (and timing out)
 *   - should become ready after the make_waitable_ready method is called
 *   - may or may not be ready at this point
 *   - should be ready after waiting on it, within the wait_timeout
 *   - should be ready still after a second wait (unless expected_to_stay_ready = false)
 *   - if expected_to_stay_ready, should become not ready after a take_data/execute
