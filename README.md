# rclcpp

This repository contains the source code for the ROS Client Library for C++ package, included with a standard install of any ROS 2 distro.

rclcpp provides the standard C++ API for interacting with ROS 2.

## Usage

`#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"` allows use of the most common elements of the ROS 2 system.

Visit the [rclcpp API documentation](http://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/rclcpp/) for a complete list of its main components.

### Examples

and [Writing a simple service and client](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Writing-A-Simple-Cpp-Service-And-Client/)
contain some examples of rclcpp APIs in use.
