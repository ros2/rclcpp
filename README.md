# rclcpp

This repository contains the source code for the ROS Client Library for C++ package, included with a standard install of any ROS 2 distro.

rclcpp provides the standard C++ API for interacting with ROS 2.

## Usage

`#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"` allows use of the most common elements of the ROS 2 system.

The link to the latest API documentation can be found on the rclcpp package info page, at the [ROS Index](https://index.ros.org/p/rclcpp/).
