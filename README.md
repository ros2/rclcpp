rclcpp provides the accepted, standard C++ API for interacting with ROS 2.

## Usage

`#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"` allows use of the most common elements of the ROS 2 system.

Visit the [rclcpp API documentation](http://docs.ros2.org/dashing/api/rclcpp/) for a complete list of its main components.
